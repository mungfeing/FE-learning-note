### New Concepts
#### viewport
- `vh` - viewport height
- `vw` - viewport width
- `vmin` - either the viewport height or width, whichever is smaller
- `vmax` - either the viewport height or width, whichever is bigger
- When setting viewport units, especially for a height, I strongly suggest setting it as a `min-height`. It'll help avoid problems when the content is taller than the viewport.

#### `box-sizing: border-box`
```
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
- As we've seen with the box model, CSS calculates the size of an element based on it's content + padding + border + margin.
- When we set a `width`, we are setting that width on the content of the element, and then all the other properties get added to create the total size.
- We can change that behavior by declaring `box-sizing: border-box`.
- This will change how the size of an element is calculated, now including both `padding` and `border`, inside the `width` (or `height`) that we set.
We often declare this on the `*` selector, which will select every element on the page. By doing this, it makes it much easier to work.
```js




```js
/* to control the size o*/
.intro *,
.main-content * {
    max-width: 400px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
```
#### `.intro p` and `.intro > p`
- When using compound selectors, we know that something like `.intro p` is a decendant selector. It will select *all* paragraphs that are a decendant of `.intro`.
- Sometimes we only want to select items that are the direct child of something though, and not *all the decendants. We can do this by using the `>` combinator.
- By using it like this `.intro > p` it will only select paragraphs if they are a direct child of `.intro`, but not if they are nested inside of something else. This can be very useful from time to time!*



### form
 -  `<form>` The form itself
 - `<label>` Describes the different form elements
 - `<input>` Where the user can input information. Many different types.
 - ` <button>`Used to submit the form (among other things)
#### The form has a few suggested attributes
```
<form action=" / success.html" method=" post">
```
#### Inputs can do a lot of different things
-  `<input type=" text">`
-  `<input type="color">`
-  `<input type=" checkbox">`
-  ` <input type="date">`
-  `<input type=" radio">`
-  ` <input type=" password" >`
-  `<input type=" email">`
-  ` <input type=" file">`

#### Labels are used to connect some text with an input (or other form element)
```
<label for="fname">First name:</label>
<input id="fname" type="text">
  or
    <label>First name:
                <input type="text">
            </label>
```

#### Tips 
- boder nees a hover state
-  border needs a  `cursor: pointer;`
- Attribute selector `input[type="text"] {}`
- for `input { font-family: inherit;}`
- Simple hover effect: 250ms


### to prevent the box from growing too big
```html
.email-collector {
    border: 3px #F18119 solid;
    width: 80%;
    max-width: 300px;
}
```


### gradients
-  gradients in CSS are set as a `background-image`.
- `linear-gradient()` a gradient that goes in a specific direction
- `radial-gradient()` a circular shaped gradient, starting in the middle and expanding out
	- `linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, yellow, orange, blue);`
	- - `linear-gradient(45deg, red, yellow, orange, blue);`
- Border-image 
```   
border-image: linear-gradient(to left, #ff713b, #ffa51d) 1;
```
### transition
> The `transition` property is a shorthand property. With it, we control:
- `transition-delay`: how long until the transition starts
- `transition-duration`: how long it takes to complete the transition (either in `ms` or `s`)
- `transition-property`: which property is being transitioned
- `transition-timing-function`: the type of curve used. This can be used to have the transition speed up or slow down as the transition runs.
- If you want to include all 4 properties, it would follow this order:`transition: property, duration,timing-function,delay`

>the transition should be put in the default selector ,Not put in the hover because 只有一半效果（光标离开的时候没有效果）
```
.btn-primary {
    background-color: #404040;
    color: white;
    transition: background-color 25;
}
.btn-primary:hover,
.btn-primary:focus{
    background-color: #F18119;
}
```
```
input {
    transform: scale(1);
    transition: transform 250ms;
}
input:focus {
    transform: scale(1.1);
}
```


#### `background-blend-mode`
`background-blend-mode` is a super fun CSS property that we can use to blend a `background-image` with a `background-color`, or even two `background-image`s!
``` 
.intro {
    background-image: url(images/ribs.jpg), linear-gradient(45deg,red, blue);
    /* background-color: #ff0000; */
    background-blend-mode: screen/multiply/overlay;}
```

Height

- Min-height 
Adding  a max-width for all elements to  prevent them from getting too big. both limit the max-size,when reach one point no matter how the view window change.
https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend/dealing-with-very-big-screens-solution-2-cWQy7NA6

```
the difference between the 2 is that the background-color/image would not change in situation 1
in other words,with a *, the original border will not be change.
1. header *{
    max-width: 500px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
如果在这里用container的话，需要额外设定高度。

2. header {
    max-width: 500px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
```
